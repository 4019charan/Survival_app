# Survival_app
I have made a simple application to see whether or not one survives if boarded on the Titanic

Feel free to try it out here : https://huggingface.co/spaces/4019Charan/Survival-app

This model is trained on the titanic dataset on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic


## At the moment I am trying hard to integrate Github Actions with the hugging face space. Any help on my workflow is appreciated.
